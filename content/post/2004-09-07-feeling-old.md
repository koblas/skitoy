Top five ways you know you're getting older:

* Only _large_ mammals live longer than you
* Your taking a collage class and some people are half your age
* You could have arrived at 12 Ophiuchi at the traveling at the speed of light
* You can reminisce about the game Pong
* You read a post that says "8th grade starts today" and you just can't relate
