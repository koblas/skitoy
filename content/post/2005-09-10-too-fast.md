  Ok&#8230; So the training program said: 18 miles @ PMP + 45-60 seconds. I knew<br /> I was going too fast, but when I got to 9 miles and saw that I was averaging<br /> a bit too fast, the goal got revised to make the first 9 and second 9 equal.<br /> All in all it was a good run, but ended up running 18m @ PMP + 25 seconds.

Legs are tired, but feel good otherwise. Ate well, though probably should
  
have drank a bit more. It was nice to see that my heart rate was sitting
  
around 147 for the last miles (or 79% of MHR).
