Ok, took a few minutes to play with the demo site for RadiantCMS&#8230;&#xA0; It depends on having functional tags to deliver functionality <r:loop> &#8230; ack..&#xA0; Not another programming language in tags.

Also played with SocialText, so close&#8230;&#xA0; But really want something thats right between CMS and Wiki (+ blog)&#8230;&#xA0;
