Just book marking [Elements of Simplicity][1] have to think about this for a few minutes..&#xA0; Funny how the trailing slide is a 2&#215;2 matrix turn 45&#8242; to make it a "diamond".

The Grid is:

> Cost &#8211; [lower &#8230; higher]
> 
> Benefit [ lower &#8230; higher]

Giving these key points:

  * 0,0 &#8211; frustration (low benefit, high cost)
  * 0,1 &#8211; contentment (high benefit, high cost)
  * 1,0 &#8211; concession (low cost, low benefit)
  * 1,1 &#8211; delight (low cost, high benefit)
  * 0.5, 0.5 &#8211; satisfaction

Of course there were 6 elements:

  * Time
  * Money
  * Physical Effort
  * Brain Cycles
  * Social Deviance
  * Non-Routine [we like routine]

Thinking about this and my Xside ideas&#8230;&#xA0; maybe life in general.
