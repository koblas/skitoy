Got the revmaster this weekend!&#xA0; Now to finish outfitting it&#8230;&#xA0; On the shopping list:

  * Pedals &#8212; Turns out that look no longer makes Delta cleat pedals, so either need to go shopping on eBay or "upgrade" two bikes worth of pedals.&#xA0; The challenge with upgrading is what to get&#8230; so it&#8217;s off to eBay.&#xA0;&#xA0; Some of the ideals:

  * Shimano PD-6620
  * Speedplay
  * Look Keo Sprint
  * Time &#8212; I really like my ATACs.&#xA0; Kill review of the [Time RXS][1]

  * Need the Pilot computer &#8212; just need to determine if I need to replace the handlebars
  * The missing bolt&#8230;&#xA0; Would you believe the person I bought it from didn&#8217;t know which way lock nuts went on and lost one.
