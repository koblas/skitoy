Startups, you want to do everything, but if you&#8217;re spread two thin you&#8217;ve gotten yourself in trouble.&nbsp; Do you allow for freedom, or do you have an iron fist and keep things focused.

Bottom line, if you don&#8217;t have **strong** leadership, you&#8217;re going to fail.&nbsp; You might fail with strong leadership, but at least you&#8217;ll be moving somewhere.

There is a corollary to the peanut butter problem, which is the DMV problem&#8230; Your system only cost $1.2B to build, already in cost and schedule overruns, now for a additional $100M you can finish it&#8230;&nbsp; yeah, right.

### Bottom line

  * Lead strong &#8212; focus on a few problems, build an expertise in these.
  * Question assumptions &#8212; if it smells _funky_ it probably is.
  * Deliver early and often &#8212; it&#8217;s the only way to measure progress!
