I bike&#8230; I bike more than average&#8230;&nbsp; While a [Poseur Jersey][1] would be fun, I was thinking on my ride to work today that a shirt/jersey that said (primarily on my ride to work):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more I bike  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The less gas I use  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more there is  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cheaper it is  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The happier you are

Maybe then a few cars would be a bit more considerate.
