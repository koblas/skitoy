A friend asked me the other day about skiing in the Tahoe area. This was for him and his wife getting back into skiing after being out of it for a few years.

_Note: I will update this page, but for now I thought this table was really useful._

### Destination Resorts

These are all resorts that are higher priced and have lots of acreage to choose from. They will have more village options for apres ski and lodging options at the base of the mountain.

### Classic &#8211; Midsized Resorts

Served by classic lodges and you&#8217;ll have to commute to and from them. They are smaller in size and typically have lower ticket prices than the Destination resorts.

### **Small**

These are the small resorts in terms of acreage, many will still only have fixed grip chairs (slower) and less vertical feet to ski. The upside is that the ticket prices and lesson prices are lower which can make for great learning hills.
